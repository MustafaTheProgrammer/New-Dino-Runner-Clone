# New-Dino-Runner-Clone
This is a remake of my first game that I've ever programmed from scratch, an ascii clone of the no internet dino runner game. This, unlike that game, is more graphical, and by utilizing text highlighting for imitating pixels, as well as using sprites too. I'm proud of this, even if it isn't the best.
